# Nested Object Value Retrieval Challenge

This challenge involves retrieving a nested value from an object using a specified key. The goal is to create a function or script that accomplishes this task.

## Problem Statement

Given a nested object and a key path, the challenge is to develop a solution to extract a specific value from within the object's nested structure.

## Your Solution

A solution script has been created to address this challenge. This script, implemented in powershell, is capable of retrieving nested values from objects based on a provided key path.

## Usage

To use the provided solution, simply run the script and pass in the required object and key path.


Feel free to adapt or use this solution in your own projects where similar functionality is needed.
